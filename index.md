## Overview

UML .FRI is a CASE tool. I know about the UML in its title, but it is not
really (only) a UML tool. It is a kind of DSM tool with UML being one
of possible modeling languages instead. For more information, please
refer to the [about](about.html) page.

*[CASE]: Computer Aided Software Engineering
*[DSM]: Domain Specific Modeling
